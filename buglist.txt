Bugs:

- addBack adds the passed value to the front, not the back
- isEmpty is true even after a value is added
- removeFront returns false even if the list has values in it, and does not
  remove any values from the list
- removeBack does the same thing removeFront does
- search seems to always return true, no matter the value passed
